# RC-car-parktronic
A remote control car(Bluetooth) that when parking, has to stop itself from crashing at the objects behind her, plus we will add some features later on for once this is done

**Hardware preparation**
Materials you'll need:

Two Arduino Uno boards.
USB cables for each Arduino.
Jumper wires (optional, depending on your setup).
Steps:

Connect the Arduino Boards:

a. Connect one Arduino Uno to your computer via a USB cable.

b. Connect the second Arduino Uno to your computer using another USB cable.

Identify the Hardware UART Pins:

The Arduino Uno boards have two hardware UART serial ports, labeled as "Serial" and "Serial1."

"Serial" is the primary hardware serial port and is connected to the USB interface for programming and serial monitoring.
"Serial1" is the secondary hardware serial port.
